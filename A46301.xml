            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Two mighty Whales we now ſaw, the one ſpouted water through two great holes in her head into the Air a great height, and making a great noiſe with puſſing and blowing, the Seamen called her a Soutler; the other was further off, about a league from the Ship, fighting with the Sword-fiſh, and the Flail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh, whoſe ſtroakes with a fin that growes upon her back like a flail, upon the back of the Whale, we heard with amazement: when preſently ſome more than half as far again we ſpied a ſpout from above, it came pouring down like a River of water; So that if they ſhould light in any Ship, ſhe were in danger to be preſently ſunk down into the Sea, and falleth with ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream violence all whole together as one drop, or as water out of a Veſſel, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a quarter of an hour, making the Sea to boyle like a pot, and if any Veſſel be near, it ſucks it in.

About 8 of the clock at night, a flame ſettled upon the main maſt, it was about the bigneſs of a great Candle, and is called by our Seamen St. <hi>Elmes</hi> fire, it comes before a ſtorm, and is commonly thought to be a Spirit; if two appear they prognoſticate ſafety: Theſe are known to the learned by the names of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lux,</hi> to the <hi>Italians</hi> by St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> and St. <hi>Hermes,</hi> by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called <hi>Corpos Santes.</hi>

                     <p>The Ninth day, about two of the clock in the afternoon, we found the head of our main maſt cloſe to the cap twiſted and ſhive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and we preſently after found the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top-maſt crackt a little above the cap; So they wolled them both, and about two of the clock in the morning 7 new long Boat oars brake away from our Star-board quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a horrid crack.</p>
                     <p>The Eleventh day, they obſerved and made the Ship to be in latitude 48 degrees 46 minuts, having a great Sea all night; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 6 of the clock in the morning we ſpake with Mr. <hi>Rupe</hi> in a Ship of <hi>Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> which came from <hi>Marcelloes;</hi> and now is <hi>Silly N.

In the afternoon one <hi>Martin Jvy</hi> a ſtripling, ſervant to Captain <hi>Thomas Cammock</hi> was whipt naked at the Cap-ſtern, with a Cat with Nine tails, for filching 9 great Lemmons out of the <hi>Chirurgeons</hi> Cabbin, which he eat rinds and all in leſs than an hours time.</p>
                     <p>The Thirteenth day we took a Sharke, a great one, and hoiſted him aboard with his two Companions (for there is never a Sharke, but hath a mate or two) that is the Pilot fiſh or Pilgrim, which lay upon his back cloſe to a long finn; the other fiſh (ſome what bigger than the Pilot) about two foot long, called a <hi>Remora,</hi> it hath no ſcales and ſticks cloſe for the Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>The Fourteenth day of <hi>June,</hi> very fog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie weather, we ſailed by an Iſland of Ice (which lay on the Star-board ſide) three leagues in length mountain high, in form of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60087:8"/>land, with Bayes and Capes like high clift land, and a River pouring off it into the Sea. We ſaw likewiſe two or three Foxes, or Devils skipping upon it. Theſe Iſlands of Ice are congealed in the North, and brought down in the ſpring-time with the Current to the banks on this ſide <hi>New-found-land,</hi> and there ſtopt, where they diſſolve at laſt to water; by that time we had ſailed half way by it, we met with a <hi>French</hi> Pickeroon. Here it was as cold as in the middle of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and ſo continued till we were ſome leagues beyond it.</p>
                     <p>The Sixteenth day we ſounded, and found 35 fathom water, upon the bank of <hi>New-found-land,</hi> we caſt our our hooks for Cod-fiſh, thick foggie weather, the Codd being taken on a Sanday morning, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries aboard threw thoſe their ſervants took into the Sea again, although they wanted freſh victuals, but the Sailers were not ſo nice, amongſt many that were taken, we had ſome that were waſted Fiſh, &amp; it is obſervable and very ſtrange, that fiſhes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do grow ſlender with age, their Tails and Heads retaining their former bigneſs; Fiſh of all Creatures have generally the biggeſt heads, and the firſt part that begins to taint in a fiſh is the head.</p>

I had not gone far before I found the footing of two Wolves, and one Goat betwixt them, whom they had driven into a hollow, betwixt two Rocks, hither I followed their footing, and perceiving by the Crowes, that there was the place of ſlaughter, I hung my piece up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my back, and upon all four clambered up to the top of the Rock, where I made ready my piece and ſhot at the dog Wolf, who was feeding upon the remainder of the Goat, which was only the fore ſhoulders, head and horns, the reſt being devoured by the ſhe-Wolf, even to the very hair of the Goat: and it is very obſervable, that when
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60087:15"/>the Wolves have kill'd a Beaſt, or a Hog, not a Dog-Wolf amongſt them offers to eat any of it, till the ſhe-Wolves have fill'd their paunches.</p>
                     <p>The Twenty fourth of <hi>September,</hi> being Munday about 4 of the clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, a fearful ſtorm of wind began to rage, called a <hi>Hurricane. It is an impetuous wind that goes commonly about the Compaſs in the ſpace of</hi> 24 <hi>hours, it began from the</hi> W. N.

At this time we had ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Gentlemen in our houſe, who came to welcome me into the Countrey; where amongſt variety of diſcourſe they told me of a young Lyon (not long before) kill'd at <hi>Piſcataway</hi> by an <hi>Indian,</hi> af a Sea-<hi>Serpeut</hi> or <hi>Snake,</hi> that lay quoiled up like a Cable upon a Rock at <hi>Cape-Ann:</hi> a Boat paſſing by with <hi>Engliſh</hi> aboard, and two <hi>Indians,</hi> they would have ſhot the <hi>Serpent,</hi> but the <hi>Indians</hi> diſſwaded them, ſaying, that if he were not kill'd out-right, they would be all in danger of their lives.</p>
                     <p>One Mr. <hi>Mittin</hi> related of a <hi>Triton</hi> or <hi>Mereman</hi> which he ſaw in <hi>Caſcebay,</hi> the Gentleman was a great Fouler, and uſed to goe out with a ſmall Boat or Canow, and fetching a compaſs about a ſmall Iſland, (there being many ſmall Iſlands in the Bay) for the advantage of a ſhot, was encountred

The next ſtory was told by Mr. <hi>Foxwell,</hi> now living in the province of <hi>Main,</hi> who having been to the Eaſtward in a Shallop, as far as <hi>Cape-Ann</hi>-a Waggon in his return was overtaken by the night, and fearing to land upon the barbarous ſhore, he put off a little further to Sea; about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night they were wakened with a loud voice from the ſhore, calling upon <hi>Foxwell, Foxwell</hi> come a ſhore, two or three times: upon the Sands they ſaw a great fire, and Men and Women hand in hand dancing round about it in a ring, after an hour or two they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and as ſoon as the day appeared, <hi>Foxwell</hi> puts into a ſmall <hi>Cove,</hi> it being about three quarters floud, and traces along the ſhore, where he found the footing of Men, Women and Children ſhod with ſhoos; and an infinite number of brands-ends thrown up by the water, but neither <hi>Indian</hi> nor <hi>Engliſh</hi> could he meet with on the ſhore, nor in the woods; theſe with many other ſtories they told me, the credit whereof I will neither impeach nor inforce, but ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Second of <hi>October,</hi> about 9 of the clock in the morning, Mr. <hi>Mavericks</hi> Negro woman came to my chamber window, and in her own Countrey language and tune ſang very loud and ſhril, going out to her, ſhe uſed a great deal of reſpect towards me, and willingly would have expreſſed her grief in <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but I apprehended it by her countenance and deportment, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I repaired to my hoſt, to learn of him the cauſe, and reſolved to intreat him in her behalf, for that I underſtood before, that ſhe had been a Queen in her own Countrey, and obſerved a very humble and dutiful garb uſed towards her by another Negro who was her maid. Mr. <hi>Maverick</hi> was deſirous to have a breed of Negroes, and therefore ſeeing ſhe would not yield by perſwaſions to company with a Negro young man he had in his houſe; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him will'd ſhe nill'd ſhe to go to bed to her, which was no ſooner done but ſhe kickt him out again, this ſhe took in high diſdain beyond her ſlavery, and this was the cauſe of her grief. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I walked into the Woods on the back ſide of the houſe, and happening into a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60087:18"/>fine broad walk (which was a ſledg-way) I wandered till I chanc't to ſpye a fruit as I thought like a pine Apple plated with ſcales, it was as big as the crown of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans hat; I made bold to ſtep unto it, with an intent to have gathered it, no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had I toucht it, but hundreds of Waſps were about me; at laſt I cleared my ſelf from them, being ſlung only by one upon the upper lip, glad I was that I ſcaped ſo well; But by that time I was come into the houſe my lip was ſwell'd ſo extreamly, that they hardly knew me but by my Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>The Tenth of <hi>October,</hi> I went aboard and we fell down to <hi>Nantaſcot,</hi> here Mr. <hi>Davies</hi> (Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi> the Apothecarie in <hi>Fleet-ſtreets</hi> Son-in-law) dyed of the Phthiſick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board on a Sunday in the afternoon. The next day Mr. <hi>Luxon</hi> our Maſter having been aſhore upon the Governours Iſland gave me half a ſcore very fair Pippins which he brought from thence, there being not one Apple-tree, nor Pear planted yet in no part of the Countrey, but upon that Iſland.</p>

                     <p>The Sixteenth day Mr. <hi>Robert Foſter,</hi> one of our paſſengers Preached aboard upon

                     <p>The Seventeenth day, towards Sun-ſet a Lanner ſettled upon our main Maſt-top, when it was dark I hired one of the Sailers to fetch her down, and I brought her into <hi>England</hi> with much ado, being fain to feed her with hard Eggs. After this day we had very cold weather at Sea, our deck in a morning ore-ſpread with hoarie froſt, and dangling Iſickles hung upon the Ropes. <hi>Some ſay the Sea is hotter in winter, than in ſummer; but I did not find it ſo.</hi>

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> take white <hi>Hellebore,</hi> which operates as fairly with them, as with the <hi>Indians,</hi> who ſteeping of it in water ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, give it to young lads gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a purpoſe to drink, if it come up they force them to drink again their vomit, (which they ſave in a Birchen-diſh) till it ſtayes with them, &amp; he that gets the victory of it is made Captain of the other lads for that year. There is a plant likewiſe, called for want of a name <hi>Clownes wound wort</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though it be not the ſame, that will heal a green wound in 24 hours, if a wiſe man have the ordering of it. Thus much for the general, I ſhall now begin to diſcover unto you the plants more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and I ſhall firſt begin with Trees, and of them, firſt with ſuch as are called in Scripture Trees of God, that is great
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60087:35"/>Trees, that grow of themſelves without planting. Pſal. 104.16, 17. <hi>Satiantur arbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Jehovae, cedri libani quas plantavit; (ubi aviculae nidificent) abietes domicilia ciconiae.</hi> The Herons take great delight to ſit basking upon the tops of theſe Trees. And I ſhall not be over large in any, having written of them in my Treatiſe of the rarities of <hi>New England,</hi> to which I refer you.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Oake</hi> I have given you an account of, and the kinds; I ſhall add the ordering of Red <hi>Oake</hi> for Wainſcot. When they have cut it down and clear'd it from the branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, they pitch the body of the Tree in a muddy place in a River, with the head downward for ſome time, afterwards they draw it out, and when it is ſeaſoned ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, they ſaw it into boards for Wainſcot, and it will branch out into curious works.</p>
                     <p>There is an admirable rare Creature in ſhape like a <hi>Buck,</hi> with Horns, of a gummy ſubſtance, which I have often found in the fall of the leaf upon the ground amongſt the withered leaves; a living Creature I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call it; having only the ſign of a mouth and eyes: ſeldom or never ſhall you meet with any of them whole, but the head and horns, or the hinder parts, broken off from the reſt; the <hi>Indians</hi> call them Tree <hi>Bucks,</hi> and have a ſuperſtitious ſaying (for I believe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60087:36"/>they never ſee any of them living) that if they can ſee a Tree-<hi>Buck</hi> walking upon the branches of an <hi>Oake</hi> when they go out in a morning to hunt, they ſhall have good luck that day. What they are good for I know not, but certainly there is ſome more than ordinary vertue in them. It is true that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in nature is ſuperfluous, and we have the Scripture to back it, that God created nothing in vain. The like Creatures they <hi>have at the</hi> Barbadoes <hi>which they call</hi> Negroes <hi>heads, found in the Sands, about two inches long, with forehead, eyes, noſe, mouth, chin, and part of the neck, they are alwayes found looſe in the Sands without any root, it is as black as Jet, but whence it comes they know not. I have read likewiſe, that in the</hi> Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>or</hi> Fortunate-Iſlands, <hi>there is found a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Creature, which Boys bring home from the mountains as oft as they would, and named them</hi> Tudeſquels, <hi>or little</hi> Germans: <hi>for they were dry'd dead Carcaſes, almoſt three footed, which any boy did eaſily carry in one of the palms of his hand, and they were of an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape; but the whole dead Carcaſe was clearly like unto Parchment, and their bones were flexible, as it were griftles: againſt the Sun, alſo, their bowels and inteſtines were ſeen.

                     <p>The Pine-Tree challengeth the next place, and that ſort which is called Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine is the principal, it is a ſtately large Tree, very tall, and ſometimes two or three fadom about: of the body the <hi>Engliſh</hi> make large <hi>Canows</hi> of 20 foot long, and two foot and a half over, hollowing of them with an Adds, and ſhaping of the outſide like a Boat.

The bark thereof is good for Ulcers in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der perſons that refuſe ſharp medicines.

I fancie my way better which is this, after the <hi>Eals</hi> are fley'd and waſht I fill their bellies with Nutmeg grated and Cloves a little bruiſed, and ſow them up with a needle and thred, then I ſtick a Clove here and there in their ſides about an inch aſunder,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60087:61"/>making holes for them with a bodkin, this done I wind them up in a wreath and put them into a kettle with half water and half white wine-vinegar, ſo much as will riſe four fingers above the <hi>Eals;</hi> in midſt of the <hi>Eals</hi> I put the bottom of a penny white loaf, and a fagot of theſe herbs following, Parſley one handful, a little ſweet Marjoram, Peniroyal and Savory, a branch of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, bind them up with a thred, and when they are boiled enough take out the <hi>Eals</hi> and pull out the threds that their bellies were ſowed up with, turn out the Nutmeg and Cloves, put the <hi>Eals</hi> in a diſh with butter and vinegar upon a chafing-diſh with coals to keep warm, then put into the broth three or four ſpoonfuls of good Ale-yeaſt with the juice of half a Lemmon; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you put in your yeaſt beat it in a porrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with ſome of the broth, then break the cruſt of bread very ſmall and mingle it well together with the broth, pour it into a deep diſh and garniſh it with the other half of the Lemmon, and ſo ſerve them up to the Table in two diſhes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Froſt fiſh</hi> is little bigger than a <hi>Gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi> and are taken in freſh brooks; when the waters are frozen they make a hole in the Ice about half a yard or yard wide, to which the fiſh repair in great numbers, where with

                     <p>The fiſh are ſwum by, and the Serpents are creeping on, terrible creatures, carrying ſtings in their tails. It will ſmart worſe than a <hi>Satyrs</hi> whip, though it were as big as Mr. <hi>Shepperds</hi> the mad Gentleman at <hi>Milton-Mowhrayes Conſtantinus Laſculus.</hi>

                     <p>The chief or Captain of theſe is the Rattle-ſnake deſcribed already in my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, in ſome places of the Countrey there are none as at <hi>Plimouth, New-town, Nahant</hi> and ſome other places, they will live on one ſide of the River, and but ſwimming over and coming into the woods dye immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.</p>
                     <p>The fat of a Rattle-ſnake is very Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign for frozen limbs, bruiſes, lameneſs by falls, Aches, Sprains. The heart of a Rattle-ſnake dried and pulverized and drunk with wine or beer is an approved remedy againſt the biting and venome of a Rattle-ſnake. Some body will give me thanks for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60087:62"/>theſe ſecrets and the reſt; <hi>Non omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus omnia conveniunt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Snake</hi> of which there are infinite numbers of various colours, ſome black, others painted with red, yellow and white, ſome again of a graſs-green colour powde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all over as it were with ſilver duſt or <hi>Muſcovie</hi>-glaſs. But there is one ſort that exceeds all the reſt, and that is the Check-quered ſnake, having as many colours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the checkquers ſhaddowing one another, as there are in a Rainbow. There are two ſorts of ſnakes, the land-ſnake and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſnake; the water-ſnake will be as big about the belly as the Calf of a mans leg; I never heard of any miſchief that ſnakes did, they kill them ſometimes for their skins and bones to make hatbands off, their skins likewiſe worn as a Garter is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedie againſt the cramp. I have found of the skins that they caſt in woods in ſome quantity, they caſt not their very skins, but only the ſuperfluous thin skin that is upon the very skin, for the very skin is baſted to the fleſh, ſo Lobſters and Crabs.</p>
                     <p>The Earth-worm, theſe are very rare and as ſmall as a horſe hair, but there is a Bug that lyes in the earth and eateth the ſeed, that is ſomewhat like a Maggot of a white colour with a red head, and is about
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60087:63"/>the bigneſs of ones finger and an inch or an inch and half long. There is alſo a dark dunniſh Worm or Bug of the bigneſs of an Oaten-ſtraw, and an inch long, that in the ſpring lye at the Root of Corn and Garden plants all day, and in the night creep out and devour them; theſe in ſome years de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy abundance of <hi>Indian</hi> Corn and Garden plants, and they have but one way to be rid of them, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have learnt of the <hi>Indians;</hi> And becauſe it is ſomewhat ſtrange, I ſhall tell you how it is, they go out into a field or garden with a Birchen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, and ſpudling the earth about the roots, for they lye not deep, they gather their diſh full which may contain about a quart or three pints, then they carrie the diſh to the Sea-ſide when it is ebbing-water and ſet it a ſwimming, the water carrieth the diſh into the Sea and within a day or two if you go into your field you may look your eyes out ſooner than find any of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sow-bugs</hi> or <hi>Millipedes</hi> there be good ſtore, but none of that ſort that are blew and turn round as a pea when they are touched; neither are there any <hi>Beetles</hi> nor <hi>Maple-bugs,</hi> but a ſtinking black and red <hi>Bug</hi> called a <hi>Cacarooch</hi> or <hi>Cockroach,</hi> and a little black <hi>Bug</hi> like a <hi>Lady-cow</hi> that breeds in skins and furrs and will eat them to their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60087:63"/>utter ſpoil. Likewiſe there be infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Tikes</hi> hanging upon the buſhes in ſummer time that will cleave to a mans garments and creep into his Breeches eating themſelves in a ſhort time into the very fleſh of a man. I have ſeen the ſtockins of thoſe that have gone through the woods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them. Beſides theſe there is a <hi>Bug,</hi> but whether it be a Native to the Countrie or a ſtranger I cannot ſay: Some are of opinion that they are brought in by the Merchant with Spaniſh goods, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt our beds moſt, all day they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but when night comes they will creep to the ſleeping wretch and bite him worſe than a flea, which raiſeth a ſwelling knub that will itch intolerably, if you ſcratch it waxeth bigger and growes to a ſcab; and if you chance to break one of the <hi>Bugs</hi> it will ſtink odiouſly: they call them <hi>Chinches</hi> or <hi>Wood-lice,</hi> they are fat, red and in ſhape like a <hi>Tike</hi> and no bigger. There are alſo Palmer-worms which is a kind of Catterpiller, theſe ſome years will devour the leaves of Trees leaving them as naked almoſt as in winter, they do much harm in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Orchards. Of <hi>Snails</hi> there are but few, and thoſe very little ones, they lye at the Roots of long graſs in moiſt places, and are no where elſe to be found.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60087:64"/>Spiders and Spinners there be many, the laſt very big and of ſeveral colours.</p>

I could never diſcover the Organ of their voice, they have a little clift in their Crown which opens, and at the ſame inſtant they ſhake their wings.</p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:60087:64"/>
                     <p>The Eſt or Swift in <hi>New-England</hi> is a moſt beautiful Creature to look upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing larger than ours, and painted with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious colours; but I lik'd him never the better for it.</p>
                     <p>Frogs too there are in ponds and upon dry land, they chirp like Birds in the ſpring, and latter end of ſummer croak like Toads. It is admirable to conſider the generating of theſe Creatures, firſt they lay their gelly on the water in ponds and ſtill waters, which comes in time to be full of black ſpots as broad as the head of a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny nail, and round, theſe ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the gleir, and after a while thruſt out a tail, then their head comes forth, after their head ſprings out their fore-legs, and then their hinder-legs, then their tail drops off, and growes to have a head and four legs too, the firſt proves a frog, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a water-nuet. The Herbaliſt uſeth to ſay by way of admiration, <hi>quaelibet herba de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp;c.</hi> So God is ſeen in the production of theſe ſmall Creatures which are a part of the Creation; <hi>Laudate Jehovam coelites, laudate eum in excelſis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Laudent nomen Jehovae quae ipſo praecipiente illico creata ſunt</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ipſae beſtiae &amp; omnes jumenta, reptilia &amp; aves alatae,</hi> Pſal. 148.</p>
                     <p>The Toad is of two ſorts, one that is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60087:65"/>ſpeckled with white, and another of a a dark earthy colour; there is of them that will climb up into Trees and ſit croaking there; but whether it be of a third ſort, or one of the other, or both, I am not able to affirm; but this I can teſtifie that there be Toads of the dark coloured kind that are as big as a groat loaf. Which report will not ſwell into the belief of my ſceptique Sirs; nor that there is a Hell, being like <hi>Salomon</hi>'s fool, Prov. 26.22. <hi>Sed ſi contun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deres ſtultum in mortario cum mola piſtillo, non recederet ab eo ſtultitia ejus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now before I proceed any further, I muſt (to prevent miſconſtructions) tell you that theſe following Creatures, though they be not properly accounted Serpents, yet they are venomous and peſtilent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. As, firſt the Rat, but he hath been brought in ſince the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came thither, but the Mouſe is a Native, of which there are ſeveral kinds not material to be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; the Bat or flitter mouſe is bigger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance than any in <hi>England</hi> and ſwarm, which brings me to the infects or cut-waſted creatures again, as firſt the honey-Bee, which are carried over by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and thrive there exceedingly, in time they may be produced from Bullocks when the wild Beaſts are deſtroyed. But the waſp is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60087:65"/>and they have a ſort of wild humble-Bee that breed in little holes in the earth. Near upon twenty years ſince there lived an old planter at <hi>Black-point,</hi> who on a Sunſhine day about one of the clock lying upon a green bank not far from his houſe, charged his Son, a lad of 12 years of age to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken him when he had ſlept two hours, the old man falls aſleep and lying upon his back gaped with his mouth wide enough for a Hawke to ſhit into it; after a little while the lad ſitting by ſpied a humble-Bee creeping out of his Fathers mouth, which taking wing flew quite out of ſight, the hour as the lad gheſt being come to awaken his Father he jogg'd him and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led aloud Father, Father, it is two a clock, but all would not rouſe him, at laſt he ſees the humble-Bee returning, who lighted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſleepers lip and walked down as the lad conceived into his belly, and preſently he awaked.</p>
                     <p>The Countrey is ſtrangely incommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with flyes, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> call Musketaes, they are like our gnats, they will ſting ſo fiercely in ſummer as to make the faces of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſwell'd and ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as if the ſmall pox for the firſt year. Likewiſe there is a ſmall black fly no bigger than a flea, ſo numerous up in the Countrey,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60087:66"/>that a man cannot draw his breath, but he will ſuck of them in: they continue about Thirty dayes ſay ſome, but I ſay three moneths, and are not only a peſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but a plague to the Countrey. There is another ſort of fly called a Gurnipper that are like our horſe-ſlyes, and will bite deſperately, making the bloud to ſpurt out in great quantity; theſe trouble our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Cattle very much, raiſing ſwellings as big as an egg in their hides. The Butterfly is of ſeveral ſorts and larger than ours; So are their Dragon-flyes.

                     <p>Of diſpoſition very inconſtant, crafty, timorous, quick of apprehenſion, and very ingenious, ſoon angry, and ſo malicious that they ſeldom forget an injury, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly cruel, witneſs their direful reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges upon one another. Prone to injurious violence and ſlaughter, by reaſon of their bloud dryed up with overmuch fire, very lecherous proceeding from choller aduſt and melancholy, a ſalt and ſharp humour; very fingurative or theeviſh, and bold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate beggars, both Men and Women guilty of Miſoxenie or hatred to ſtrangers, a quality appropriated to the old Brittains, all of them Cannibals, caters of humane fleſh. And ſo were formerly the Heathen-<hi>Iriſh,</hi> who uſed to feed upon the Buttocks of Boyes and Womens Paps; it ſeems it is natural to Savage people ſo to do. I have read in Relations of the <hi>Indians</hi> amongſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that they would not eat a <hi>Spaniard</hi> till they had kept him two or three dayes to wax tender, becauſe their fleſh was hard. At <hi>Martins</hi> vinyard, an Iſland that lyes South to <hi>Plimouth</hi> in the way to <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> certain <hi>Indians</hi> (whilſt I was in the Countrey) ſeiſed upon a Boat that put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>Their houſes which they call <hi>Wigwams,</hi> are built with Poles pitcht into the ground of a round form for moſt part, ſometimes ſquare, they bind down the tops of their poles, leaving a hole for ſmoak to go out at, the reſt they cover with the bark of Trees, and line the inſide of their <hi>Wigwams</hi> with mats made of Ruſhes painted with ſeveral colours, one good poſt they ſet up in the middle that reaches to the hole in the top, with a ſtaff a croſs before it at a convenient height, they knock in a pin on which they hang their Kettle, beneath that they ſet up a broad ſtone for a back which keepeth the poſt from burning; round by the walls they ſpread their mats and skins where the men ſleep whilſt their women dreſs theis victuals, they have commonly two doors, one ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the South, the other to the North, and according as the wind ſits, they cloſe up one door with bark and hang a <hi>Dears</hi> skin or the like before the other. Towns they have none, being alwayes removing from one place to another for conveniency of food, ſometimes to thoſe places where one ſort of fiſh is moſt plentiful, other whiles where others are. I have ſeen half
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60087:68"/>hundred of their <hi>Wigwams</hi> together in a piece of ground and they ſhew prettily, within a day or two, or a week they have been all diſperſed. They live for the moſt part by the Sea-ſide, eſpecially in the ſpring and ſummer quarters, in winter they are gone up into the Countrie to hunt <hi>Deer</hi> and <hi>Beaver,</hi> the younger webbs going with them. Tame Cattle they have none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Lice, and Doggs of a wild breed that they bring up to hunt with.</p>
                     <p>Wives they have two or three, according to the ability of their bodies and ſtrength of their concupiſcence, who have the eaſieft labours of any women in the world; they will go out when their time is come alone, carrying a board with them two foot long, and a foot and half broad, bor'd full of holes on each ſide, having a foot beneath like a Jack that we pull Boots off with, on the top of the board a broad ſtrap of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which they put over their fore-head, the board hanging at their back; when they are come to a Buſh or a Tree that they fancy they lay them down and are delivered in a trice, not ſo much as groaning for it, they wrap the child up in a young <hi>Beaver</hi>-skin with his heels cloſe to his britch, leaving a little hole if it be a Boy for his Cock to peep out at; and lace him down to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60087:69"/>board upon his back, his knees reſting upon the foot beneath, then putting the ſtrap of leather upon their fore-head with the infant hanging at their back home they trudge; What other ceremonies they uſe more than dying of them with a liquor of boiled <hi>Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>-Bark, and their throwing of them into the water if they ſuſpect the Child to be gotten by any other Nation, to ſee if he will ſwim, if he ſwim they acknowledge him for their own, their names they give them when they are men grown, and covet much to be called after our <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner, <hi>Robin, Harry, Phillip</hi> and the like, very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent they are to their Children, and their children ſometimes to their Parents, but if they live ſo long that they become a burden to them, they will either ſtarve them or bury them alive, as it was ſuppoſed an <hi>Indian</hi> did his Mother at <hi>Caſco</hi> in 1669.</p>
                     <p>Their Apparel before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came amongſt them, was the skins of wild Beaſts with the hair on, Buskins of <hi>Deers</hi>-skin or <hi>Mooſe</hi> dreſt and drawn with lines into ſeveral works, the lines being coloured with yellow, blew or red, Pumps too they have, made of tough skins without ſoles.

They are very proud as appeareth by their ſetting themſelves out with white and blew Beads of their own making, and painting of their faces with the above mentioned colours, they weave ſometimes curious Coats with <hi>Turkie</hi> feathers for their Children.</p>
                     <p>Their Diet is Fiſh and Fowl, Bear, Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, Rattoon and Deer; dry'd Oyſters, <hi>Lobſters</hi> roſted or dryed in the ſmoak, <hi>Lampres</hi> and dry'd <hi>Mooſe</hi>-tongues, which they eſteem a diſh for a <hi>Sagamor;</hi> hard eggs boiled and made ſmall and dryed to thicken their broth with, falt they have not the uſe of, nor bread, their <hi>Indian</hi> Corn and Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney beans they boil, and ſometimes eat their Corn parcht or roaſted in the ear againſt the fire; they feed likewiſe upon earth-nuts,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60087:70"/>or ground-nuts, rocts of water-Lillies, Cheſ-nuts, and divers ſorts of Berries. They beat their Corn to powder and put it up into bags, which they make uſe of when ſtormie weather or the like will not ſuffer them to look out for their food. <hi>Pompiens</hi> and water-<hi>Mellons</hi> too they have good ſtore; they have prodigious ſtomachs, devouring a cruel deal, meer <hi>voragoes,</hi> never giving over eating as long as they have it, between meals ſpending their time in ſleep till the next kettlefull is boiled, when all is gone they ſatisfie themſelves with a ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the meal, making it ſerve as the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal bit amongſt the old <hi>Britains,</hi> which taken to the mountenance of a Bean would ſatisfie both thirſt and hunger.

                     <p>They live long, even to an hundred years of age, if they be not cut off by their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, war, and the plague, which together with the ſmall pox hath taken away abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>An <hi>Engliſh</hi> woman ſuffering an <hi>Indian</hi> to have carnal knowledge of her, had an <hi>Indian</hi> cut out exactly in red cloth ſewed

                     <p>Scolds they gag and ſet them at their doors for certain hours, for all comers and goers by to gaze at.</p>
                     <p>Stealing is puniſhed with reſtoring four fould, if able; if not, they are ſold for ſome years, and ſo are poor debtors.</p>

                     <p>The Governments of their Churches are Independent and Presbyterial, every Church (for ſo they call their particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations) have one Paſtor, one Teacher, Ruling Elders and Deacons.</p>
                     <p>They that are members of their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es have the Sacraments adminiſtred to them, the reſt that are out of the pale as they phraſe it, are denyed it.

                     <p>The Government both Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical is in the hands of the thorow-pac'd Independents and rigid Presbyterians.</p>
                     <p>The groſe <hi>Goddons,</hi> or great maſters, as alſo ſome of their Merchants are damnable rich; generally all of their judgement, inexplicably covetous and proud, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your gifts but as an homage or tribute due to their tranſcendency, which is a fault their Clergie are alſo guilty of, whoſe living is upon the bounty of their hearers. On Sundays in the afternoon when Sermon is ended the people in the Galleries come down and march two a breaſt up one Ile and down the other, until they come before the desk, for Pulpit they have none: before the desk is a long pue where the Elders and Deacons ſit, one of them with a mony box in his hand, into which the people as they paſs put their offering, ſome a ſhilling, ſome two ſhillings, half a Crown, five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings according to their ability and good will, after this they conclude with a Pſalm; but this by the way.</p>

The chiefeſt cauſe of <hi>Noah</hi>'s floud, Prov. 27.26. <hi>Agni erant ad veſtitum tuum,</hi> is a frequent Text among them, no trading for a ſtranger with them, but with a <hi>Graecian</hi> faith, which is not to part with your ware without ready money, for they are generally in their payments recuſant and ſlow, great Syndies, or cenſors, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers of other mens manners, and ſavagely factious amongſt themſelves.</p>

                     <p>But miſtake me not to general ſpeeches, none but the guilty take exceptions, there are many ſincere and religious people amongſt them, deſcryed by their charity and humility (the true Characters of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) by their Zenodochie or hoſpitality, by their hearty ſubmiſſion to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign the King of <hi>England,</hi> by their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and honeſt labour in their callings, amongſt theſe we may account the Royaliſts, who are lookt upon with an evil eye and

                     <p>They have ſtore of Children, and are well accommodated with Servants; many hands make light work, many hands make a full fraught, but many mouths eat up all, as ſome old planters have experimented; of theſe ſome are <hi>Engliſh,</hi> others <hi>Negroes:</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there are can eat till they ſweat, and work till they freeze; &amp; of the females that are like Mrs. <hi>Winters</hi> paddocks, very tender fingerd in cold weather.</p>
                     <p>There are none that beg in the Countrey, but there be Witches too many, bottle-bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied Witches amongſt the Quakers, and others that produce many ſtrange apparitions if you will believe report, of a <hi>Shallop</hi> at Sea man'd with women, of a Ship and a great red Horſe ſtanding by the main-maſt, the Ship being in a ſmall <hi>Cove</hi> to the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vaniſhed of a ſuddain.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60087:98"/>and taken in the pap of an Apple. I helped many of them with a ſweating medicine only.</p>
                     <p>Alſo they are troubled with a diſeaſe in the mouth or throat which hath proved mortal to ſome in a very ſhort time, Quinſies, and Impoſtumations of the Almonds, with great diſtempers of cold. Some of our <hi>New-England</hi> writers affirm that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> are never or very rarely heard to ſneeze or cough, as ordinarily they do in <hi>England,</hi> which is not true. For a cough or ſtitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cold, Wormwood, Sage, Marygolds, and Crabs-claws boiled in poſſet-drink and drunk off very warm, is a ſoveraign medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
                     <p>Pleuriſies and Empyemas are frequent there, both cured after one and the ſame way; but the laſt is a deſperate diſeaſe and kills many. For the Pleuriſie I have given <hi>Coriander</hi>-ſeed prepared, <hi>Carduus</hi>-ſeed, and <hi>Harts-horn</hi> pulverized with good ſucceſs, the doſe one dram in a cup of Wine.</p>
                     <p>The Stone terribly afflicts many, and the Gout, and Sciatica, for which take Onions roaſted, peeled and ſtampt, then boil them with neats-feet oyl and Rhum to a plaiſter, and apply it to the hip.</p>
                     <p>Head-aches are frequent, Palſies, Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Worms, Noli-me-tangeres, Cancers,

                     <p>For kibed heels, to heal them take the yelloweſt part of Rozen, pulverize it and work it in the palm of your hand with the tallow of a Candle to a ſalve, and lay of it to the ſore.</p>
                     <p>For frozen limbs, a plaiſter framed with Soap, Bay-ſalt, and Moloſſes is ſure, or Cow-lung boiled in milk and applyed.</p>
                     <p>For Warts and Corns, bathe them with Sea-water.</p>

                     <p>There was in the Countrey not long ſince living two men that voided worms ſeven times their length. Likewiſe a young maid that was troubled with a ſore pricking at her heart, ſtill as ſhe lean'd her body or ſtept down with her ſoot to the one ſide or the other; this maid during her diſtemper voided worms of the length of a finger all hairy with black heads; it ſo fell out that the maid dyed; her friends deſirous to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the cauſe of the diſtemper of her heart, had her open'd, and found two crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bones growing upon the top of the heart, which as ſhe bowed her body to the right or left ſide would job their points into one and the ſame place, till they had worn a hole quite through. At <hi>Cape-Porpus</hi> lived an honeſt poor planter of middle-ige, and ſtrong of body, but ſo extreamly troubled with two lumps (or wens as I conjectured) within him, on each ſide one, that he could not reſt for them day nor night, being of great weight, and ſwagging to the one ſide or the other, according to the motion or poſture of his body; at laſt he dyed in <hi>Anno</hi> 1668 as I think, or thereabouts. Some Chirurgeons there were that proffered to open him, but his wife would not aſſent to it, and ſo his diſeaſe was hidden in the Grave.</p>

Over this is an other skin of a tawny colour, and upon that <hi>Epidermis</hi> or <hi>Cuticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> the flower of the skin (which is that Snakes caſt) and this is tawny alſo, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the blew skin mingling with the tawny makes them appear black.

                     <p>I have given you an Account of ſuch plants as proſper there, and of ſuch as do not; but ſo briefly, that I conceive it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to afford you ſome what more of them. <hi>Plantain</hi> I told you ſprang up in the Countrey after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came, but it is but one ſort, and that is broad-leaved plantain.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> thrive exceedingly there and are very large, the Collibuy or humming-Bird is much pleaſed with them. Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> dames make Syrup of them without fire, they ſteep them in Wine till it be of a deep colour, and then they put to it ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> it will keep as long as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                        <hi>Eglantine</hi> or ſweet <hi>Bryer</hi> is beſt ſowen with <hi>Juniper-berries,</hi> two or three to one <hi>Eglantine-berry</hi> put into a hole made with a ſtick, the next year ſeparate and remove them to your banks, in three years time they will make a hedge as high as a man, which you may keep thick and handſome with cutting.</p>

I have obſerved, that when a land of <hi>Wheat</hi> hath been ſmitten with a blaſt at one Corner, it begins at the ſtem (which will be ſpotted and goes upwards to the ear making it fruitleſs: in 1669 the pond that lyeth between <hi>Water-town</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> caſt its fiſh dead upon the ſhore, forc't by a mineral vapour as was conjectured.</p>

It was affirmed by one Mr. <hi>Woolcut</hi> (a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony) at the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Meſſe (of which I was) aboard the Ship I came home in, that he made Five hundred Hogſheads of <hi>Syder</hi> out of his own Orchard in one year. <hi>Syder</hi> is very plentiful in the Countrey, ordinarily ſold for Ten ſhillings a Hogſhead. At the Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes

Take of <hi>Maligo-Raiſons,</hi> ſtamp them and put milk to them, and put them in an <hi>Hippocras</hi>-bag and let it drain out of it ſelf, put a quantity of this with a ſpoonful or two of Syrup of <hi>Clove-Gilliflowers</hi> into every bottle, when you bottle your <hi>Syder,</hi> and your <hi>Planter</hi> will have a liquor that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds <hi>paſſada,</hi> the Nectar of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>

Here I firſt met with that excreſcence called <hi>Hippomanes,</hi> which by ſome is ſaid to grow on the forehead of a foal new caſt, and that the Mare bites it off as ſoon as foaled; but this is but a fable. A neighbour at <hi>Black point</hi> having a Mare with foal tyed her up in his Barn, the next day ſhe foaled, and the man ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſpied a thing like a foals tongue to drop out of the foals mouth, which he took up and preſented me with it, telling me withall, that he had heard many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things reported of it, and that it was rank poyſon. I accepted of it gladly and brought it home with me, when it was dry it lookt like Glow, but of a dark brown colour; to omit all other uſes for it, this I can aſſure you that a piece of it ſoakt in warm water or cold, will take ſport out of wollen Clothes being tub'd thereon.</p>

                     <p>Of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poultry too there is good ſtore, they have commonly three broods in a year; the hens by that time they are three years old have ſpurs like the Cock, but not altogether ſo big, but as long, they uſe to crow often, which is ſo rare a thing in other Countries, that they have a proverb <hi>Gallina recinit</hi> a Hen crowes. And in <hi>England</hi> it is accounted ominous; therefore our Farmers wives as ſoon as they hear a Hen crow wring off her neck, and ſo they ſerve their ſpur'd Hens, becauſe they ſhould not break their Eggs with their ſpurs when they ſit. In the year 1637. which was when I went my firſt Voyage to <hi>New-England</hi> a good woman brought aboard with her a luſty Cock and Hen that had horns like ſpurs growing out on each ſide of their Combs, but ſhe ſpoiled the breed, killing of them at Sea, to feed upon, for ſhe loved a freſh bit.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Anno</hi> 1647/8. Certain <hi>Indians</hi> coming to our houſe clad in <hi>Deere-skin</hi> coats, deſired leave to lodge all night in our kitchin, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very rainie ſeaſon, ſome of them lay down in the middle of the Room, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under the Table, in the morning they
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60087:103"/>went away before any of the people were up; the poultry had their breakfaſt uſually in cold weather in the kitchin, and becauſe they ſhould not hinder the paſſing of the people too and again, it was thrown under the Table; in the afternoon they began to hang the wing, in the night the ſickeſt dropt dead from the perch, and the next day moſt of them dyed; we could not of a ſudden gheſs at the cauſe, but thought the <hi>Indians</hi> had either bewitched, or poyſoned them: it came at laſt into my head, ſeeing their Crops very full, or rather much ſwell'd, to open them, where I found as much <hi>Deers</hi> hair as Corn, they that pickt up none of the hair lived and did well.</p>
                     <p>In the year 1667. <hi>October</hi> the 7th amongſt our poultry we had one white game Cock of the <hi>French</hi> k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I cauſed her to draw him, when his guts were all drawn our ſhe put in her hand again and felt a lump in his body as big as a half-peny loaf, ſtrongly faſtned to his back, and much ado ſhe had to pull it out; I found it to be a tuff bag, containing ſtuff like liver, and very heavie, at one end
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60087:103"/>of the bag, another little bag filled with a fatty matter, his gizard, liver, and heart waſted. The Pipe or Roupe is a common diſeaſe amongſt their poultry infecting one another with it. I conceive it cometh of a cold moiſture of the brain, they will be very ſleepie with it, the beſt cure for it is <hi>Garlick,</hi> and ſmoaking of them with dryed <hi>Hyſope.</hi>

                     <p>The Fourteenth day we came up with <hi>Paſcataway,</hi> or <hi>Paſcatique,</hi> where there is a large River and a fair harbour, within here is ſeated a Colony, properly belonging to the Heirs of Captain <hi>Maſon</hi> ſometime ſince of <hi>London;</hi> but taken into the Colony of <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> by what right I will not here diſcuſs.</p>
