            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Turtle</hi> or <hi>Tortoi≈øe</hi> is of two ≈øorts Sea-<hi>Turtles</hi> and land-<hi>Turtles:</hi> of Sea-<hi>Turtles</hi> there are five ≈øorts, of land-<hi>Turtles</hi> three ≈øorts, one of which is a right land-<hi>Turtles</hi> that ≈øeldom or never goes into the water, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two being the River-<hi>Turtle,</hi> and the pond-<hi>Turtle:</hi> there are many of the≈øe in the brooke <hi>Chy≈øon</hi> in the <hi>Holy land.</hi> The a≈øhes of a Sea-<hi>Turtle</hi> mixt with oyl or <hi>Bears</hi>-grea≈øe cau≈øeth hair to grow: the ≈øhell of a land-<hi>Turtle</hi> burnt and the a≈øhes di≈ø≈øolved in wine and oyl to an unguent healeth chaps and ≈øores of the feet: the fle≈øh burnt and the a≈øhes mixt with wine and oyl healeth ≈øore legs: the a≈øhes of the burnt ≈øhell and the whites of eggs compounded together hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth chaps in womens nipples; and the head pulverized with it prevents the falling of the hair, and will heal the Hemorrhoids, fir≈øt wa≈øhing of them with white-wine; and then ≈øtrewing on the powder.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lob≈øter,</hi> which ≈øome ≈øay is at fir≈øt a <hi>whelk,</hi> I have ≈øeen a <hi>Lob≈øter</hi> that weighed twenty pound, they ca≈øt their ≈øhell-coats in the ≈øpring, and ≈øo do <hi>Crabs;</hi> having underneath a thin red skin which growes thicker and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60087:60"/>hard in ≈øhort time. The <hi>Indians</hi> feed much upon this fi≈øh, ≈øome they ro≈øt, and ≈øome they dry as they do <hi>Lampres</hi> and <hi>Oy≈øters</hi> which are delicate breakfa≈øt meat ≈øo ordered, the <hi>Oy≈øters</hi> are long ≈øhell'd, I have had of them nine inches long from the point to the toe, containing an <hi>Oy≈øter</hi> like tho≈øe the Latines called <hi>Tridacuan</hi> that were to be cut into three pieces before they could get them into their mouths, very fat and ≈øweet.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Mu≈øcle</hi> is of two ≈øorts, Sea-<hi>mu≈øcles</hi> in which they find Pearl and river-<hi>mu≈øcles.</hi> Sea-<hi>mu≈øcles</hi> dryed and pulverized and laid upon the ≈øores of the <hi>Piles</hi> and <hi>hemorrhoids</hi> with oyl will perfectly cure them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Whore</hi> is a ≈øhell-fi≈øh, the ≈øhells are called whores-eggs, being fine round white ≈øhells, in ≈øhape like a <hi>Mexico</hi> pompion, but no bigger than a good large Hens-egg; they are wrought down the ≈øides with little knobs and holes very prettily, but are but thin and brittle.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Perriwig</hi> is a ≈øhell-fi≈øh that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap>h in the Sands flat and round as a ≈øhovel-board piece and very little thicker; the≈øe at a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hole in the middle of the ≈øhell thru≈øt out a cap of hair, but upon the lea≈øt motion of any danger it drawes it in again.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trouts</hi> there be good ≈øtore in every brook, ordinarily two and twenty inches
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60087:60"/>long, their grea≈øe is good for the <hi>Piles</hi> and <hi>clifts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eal</hi> is of two ≈øorts, ≈øalt-water <hi>Eals</hi> and fre≈øh-water <hi>Eals;</hi> the≈øe again are di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhed into yellow bellied <hi>Eals</hi> and ≈øilver bellied <hi>Eals;</hi> I never eat better <hi>Eals</hi> in no part of the world that I have been in, than are here. They that have no mind or lea≈øure to take them, may buy of an <hi>Indian</hi> half a dozen ≈øilver bellied <hi>Eals</hi> as big as tho≈øe we u≈øually give 8 pence or 12 pence a piece for at <hi>London,</hi> for three pence or a groat. There is ≈øeveral wayes of cooking them, ≈øome love them roa≈øted, others baked, and many will have them fryed; but they plea≈øe my palate be≈øt when they are boiled, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way it is to boil them in half water, half wine with the bottom of a manchet, a fagot of Par≈øley, and a little winter ≈øavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when they are boiled they take them out and break the bread in the broth, and put to it three or four ≈øpoonfuls of ye≈øt, and a piece of ≈øweet butter, this they pour to their <hi>Eals</hi> laid upon ≈øippets and ≈øo ≈øerve it up. I fancie my way better which is this, after the <hi>Eals</hi> are fley'd and wa≈øht I fill their bellies with Nutmeg grated and Cloves a little brui≈øed, and ≈øow them up with a needle and thred, then I ≈øtick a Clove here and there in their ≈øides about an inch a≈øunder,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60087:61"/>making holes for them with a bodkin, this done I wind them up in a wreath and put them into a kettle with half water and half white wine-vinegar, ≈øo much as will ri≈øe four fingers above the <hi>Eals;</hi> in mid≈øt of the <hi>Eals</hi> I put the bottom of a penny white loaf, and a fagot of the≈øe herbs following, Par≈øley one handful, a little ≈øweet Marjoram, Peniroyal and Savory, a branch of Ro≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, bind them up with a thred, and when they are boiled enough take out the <hi>Eals</hi> and pull out the threds that their bellies were ≈øowed up with, turn out the Nutmeg and Cloves, put the <hi>Eals</hi> in a di≈øh with butter and vinegar upon a chafing-di≈øh with coals to keep warm, then put into the broth three or four ≈øpoonfuls of good Ale-yea≈øt with the juice of half a Lemmon; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you put in your yea≈øt beat it in a porrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with ≈øome of the broth, then break the cru≈øt of bread very ≈ømall and mingle it well together with the broth, pour it into a deep di≈øh and garni≈øh it with the other half of the Lemmon, and ≈øo ≈øerve them up to the Table in two di≈øhes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fro≈øt fi≈øh</hi> is little bigger than a <hi>Gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon</hi> and are taken in fre≈øh brooks; when the waters are frozen they make a hole in the Ice about half a yard or yard wide, to which the fi≈øh repair in great numbers, where with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60087:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>≈ømall nets bound to a hoop about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of a fiskin-hoop with a ≈øtaff fa≈øtned to it they lade them out of the hole. I have not done with the fi≈øh yet, being willing to let you know all of them that are to be ≈øeen and catch'd in the Sea and fre≈øh waters in <hi>New-England,</hi> and becau≈øe I will not tire your patience overmuch, having no occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to enlarge my di≈øcour≈øe, I ≈øhall only name them and ≈øo conclude.</p>
